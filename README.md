This POC website is powered by the [observable framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/). With this framework, we're able to periodically fetch and import the [WCA database](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/export/results), run queries on this data and render this data using the framework. This is a powerful system for being able to update queries daily and rendering them with ease.
